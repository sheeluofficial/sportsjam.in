 Cloning www.sportsjam.in: A little functional and more visual clone.
 
Through this blog, I am going to share my journey of working on My first individual project as a web developer student at Masai School.
So I had a problem statement that I have to create a clone of a website called sportsjam.in . Also I can use my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Advance Javascript, slick and cloud flair library and API knowledge.

On Monday, 14th of January, 2022 I was assigned a project that I had to build within 1 weeks, and on the last day, from every batch best teams would be selected to present their project to the respective Judges. I had to build the project with whatever skills I were taught in unit 1, unit 2 and unit 3 at Masai school, so in my case, it was HTML, CSS, Javascript ,Advance Javascript and API Request. As it was an individual project so I alone had to build front-end and back-end.

The blog is divided into three parts -
Firstly we will understand what the project statement is about.

Some snapshot of these project.

At last, some input that I have learned while working on the project as a beginner will be shared.

Some Snapshots of our project that we made :-

Inputs for beginners-

This was the third project I worked on at Masai, and the things I'm going to share are stuff I realized, will benefit someone new to web development or who is going to work for the very first time on a project. So here it is.

The outcome and important learning from the project :-

This entire journey of making the project was awesome.I learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave me a lot of confidence. Although I could have done more such as we could have added timer and there were some more functionalities that could have been done, but yeah the time didn't permitted me to go further. But I will surely improve it.
